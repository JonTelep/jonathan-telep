# Hello! I am jonathan telep.

I am a senior software engineer trying to escape the 9-5.I have lost my passion for engineering working on boring data sets at my employers and am now working to rejuvenate my passion. No more increasing shareholder value, but more increasing my independent value with hopes of being my own boss. This journey began by starting to be very active on X as [@telep_io](https://x.com/telep_io) where I (will) post my projects and interact with my interests including shitposting. 

My main goal is to try to build a following of like-minded people to interact with. As we can all benefit from each other's work as well as profit from eachothers engagement thanks to X's monetization share. 

You will find some of my projects are silly and just were built from an idea that popped into my head. Some will be more serious SaaS applications that I use myself. Just build and ship is what I've learned thus far and am going to abide by that lifestyle moving forward.

## Current Projects:
- The website you are reading this on; A website to share my projects and thoughts.
- MinesSwept; A social experiment created on a single page app of a giant minesweeper game where everyone works together to solve the minesweeper board.

## Future Projects:
- LetsTalkStatistics; My personal collection of statistics I've found interesting. Around Finance, Economics, Politics
