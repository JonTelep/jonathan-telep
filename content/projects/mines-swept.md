# Mines Swept

Mines Swept is a social experience that I am working on. It is a simple mine-sweeper game on a single page wishing to be completed by various users. The game mine-sweeper is a game that I alwasy go back to generally on a flights and love the simplicty yet the complexity that it can have. Simple math to find the bombs as well as pure luck sometimes.

Mines Swept will be a single page application that will allow N number of users to join via webhooks and try to complete the game. The one that fails will be publicly shamed on an active leaderboard.
